# pipeComp, a general framework for the evaluation of computational pipelines, reveals performant single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing tools


## Manuscript and figures

* The main manuscript is in tex format in [draft.tex](draft.tex).

* The main figures are in the `main_figures` folder, each produced by its own `Rmd` file.

* The supplementary figures are in `supplementary_figures/`, compiled as pdf through [supp_figures.Rmd](supplementary_figures/supp_figures.Rmd) which imports the various pieces of supplementary from the other `Rmd` in the folder. The compiled pdf is in [supplementary_figures/supp_figures.pdf](supplementary_figures/supp_figures.pdf).

## Datasets and simulations

* The code for generating the simulations are in `simulations/`

* The datasets themselves are not stored on github but on figshare https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11787210.v1 . To work with the markdowns, these datasets should be placed in a `datasets/` folder at the root of the repo.
