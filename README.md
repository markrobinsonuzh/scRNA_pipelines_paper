# scRNAseq pipeline comparison paper

The main manuscript is in tex format in [bmc_article.tex](bmc_article.tex)

The main figures are in the `main_figures` folder, each produced by its own `Rmd` file. The supplementary figures are in the various `supplementary_figures` files, compiled as pdf.

Rendering some of the R markdowns for supplementaries requires, in addition to the necessary packages, `datasets` (in the repo's root) to be softlinked to the folder containing the SCE objects (not included in this repository). Other (smaller) pieces of data are included in the `data` folder.
