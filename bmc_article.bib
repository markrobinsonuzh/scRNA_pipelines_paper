	abstract = {Background: Single-cell RNASeq is a powerful tool for measuring gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. A significant challenge in the analysis of this data is the large amount of zero values, representing either missing data or no expression. Several imputation approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue, but since these methods generally rely on structure inherent to the dataset under consideration they may not provide any additional information.
Methods: We evaluated the risk of generating false positive or irreproducible results when imputing data with five different methods. We applied each method to a variety of simulated datasets as well as to permuted real single-cell RNASeq datasets and consider the number of false positive gene-gene correlations and differentially expressed genes. Using matched 10X Chromium and Smartseq2 data from the Tabula Muris database we examined the reproducibility of markers before and after imputation.
Results: The extent of false-positive signals introduced by imputation varied considerably by method. Data smoothing based methods, MAGIC and knn-smooth, generated a very high number of false-positives in both real and simulated data. Model-based imputation methods typically generated fewer false-positives but this varied greatly depending on how well datasets conformed to the underlying model. Furthermore, only SAVER exhibited reproducibility comparable to unimputed data across matched data.
Conclusions: Imputation of single-cell RNASeq data introduces circularity that can generate false-positive results. Thus, statistical tests applied to imputed data should be treated with care. Additional filtering by effect size can reduce but not fully eliminate these effects. Of the methods we considered, SAVER was the least likely to generate false or irreproducible results, thus should be favoured over alternatives if imputation is necessary.},

However, the current lack of gold-standard benchmarking datasets makes it difficult for researchers to evaluate the performance of the many methods. Here, we designed and carried out a realistic benchmark experiment that included mixtures of single cells or ‘pseudo-cells’ created by sampling admixtures of cells or RNA from 3 distinct cancer cell lines. Altogether we generated 10 datasets using a combination of droplet and plate-based scRNA-seq protocols, with varying data quality, population heterogeneity and noise levels. Using these benchmark datasets, we compared different protocols, evaluated the spike-in standard and multiple data analysis methods for tasks ranging from normalization and imputation, to clustering, trajectory analysis and data integration. Evaluation of methods across multiple datasets revealed some that performed well in general and others that suited specific situations. Our dataset and analysis provide a comprehensive comparison framework for benchmarking most popular scRNA-seq analysis tasks.},

Measurements from this technology are aﬀected by many technical artifacts, including batch eﬀects. In analogous bulk gene expression experiments, external references, e.g., synthetic gene spike-ins often from the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC), may be incorporated to the experimental protocol for use in adjusting measurements for technical artifacts. In scRNA-seq experiments, the use of external spike-ins is controversial due to dissimilarities with endogenous genes and uncertainty about suﬃcient precision of their introduction. Instead, endogenous genes with highly stable expression could be used as references within scRNA-seq to help normalize the data. First, however, a speciﬁc notion of stable expression at the single cell level needs to be formulated; genes could be stable in absolute expression, in proportion to cell volume, or in proportion to total gene expression. Diﬀerent types of stable genes will be useful for diﬀerent normalizations and will need diﬀerent methods for discovery.},

We propose that the Pearson residuals from ’regularized negative binomial regression’, where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the inﬂuence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overﬁt scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation, and improves common downstream analytical tasks including variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and diﬀerential expression. Our procedure can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

Normalization removes systematic biases in sequencing coverage between cells, while the log-transformation ensures that downstream computational procedures operate on relative rather than absolute differences in expression. We show that the log-transformation can introduce systematic errors when cells vary in sequencing coverage, leading to spurious non-zero differences in expression and artificial population structure in simulations. We observe similar effects in real scRNA-seq data where the difference in transformed values between groups of cells is not an accurate proxy for the log-fold change.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling has revealed remarkable variation in transcription, suggesting that expression of many genes at the single-cell level are intrinsically stochastic and noisy. Yet, on cell population level, a subset of genes traditionally referred to as housekeeping genes (HKGs) are found to be stably expressed in different cell and tissue types. It is therefore critical to question whether stably expressed genes (SEGs) can be identified on the single-cell level, and if so, how their expression stability can be assessed? We have developed a computational framework for ranking expression stability of genes in single cells. Here we evaluate the proposed framework and characterize SEGs derived from two scRNA-seq datasets that profile early human and mouse development. Results: Here, we show that gene expression stability indices derived from the early human and mouse development scRNA-seq datasets are highly reproducible and conserved across species. We demonstrate that SEGs identified from single cells based on their stability indices are considerably more stable than HKGs defined previously from cell populations across 10 diverse biological systems. Our analyses indicate that SEGs are inherently more stable at the single-cell level and their characteristics reminiscent of HKGs, suggesting their potential role in sustaining essential functions in individual cells. Conclusions: SEGs identified in this study have immediate utility both for understanding variation/stability of single-cell transcriptomes and for practical applications including scRNA-seq data normalization, the proposed framework can be applied to identify genes with stable expression in other scRNA-seq datasets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
