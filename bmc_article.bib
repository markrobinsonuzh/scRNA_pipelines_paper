A common method to estimate this multiplet frequency is to mix two different types of cells (e.g., human and mouse), and then determine how often the transcriptomes contain transcripts from both cell types. When the two cell types are mixed in equal proportion, the calculation of the multiplet frequency from the frequency of mixed transcriptomes is straightforward. But surprisingly, there are no published descriptions of how to calculate the multiplet frequency in the general case when the cell types are mixed unequally. Here, I derive equations to analytically calculate the multiplet frequency from the numbers of observed pure and mixed transcriptomes when two cell types are mixed in arbitrary proportions, under the assumption that the loading of cells into droplets or wells is Poisson.},

	abstract = {Background: Single-cell RNASeq is a powerful tool for measuring gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. A significant challenge in the analysis of this data is the large amount of zero values, representing either missing data or no expression. Several imputation approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue, but since these methods generally rely on structure inherent to the dataset under consideration they may not provide any additional information.
Methods: We evaluated the risk of generating false positive or irreproducible results when imputing data with five different methods. We applied each method to a variety of simulated datasets as well as to permuted real single-cell RNASeq datasets and consider the number of false positive gene-gene correlations and differentially expressed genes. Using matched 10X Chromium and Smartseq2 data from the Tabula Muris database we examined the reproducibility of markers before and after imputation.
Results: The extent of false-positive signals introduced by imputation varied considerably by method. Data smoothing based methods, MAGIC and knn-smooth, generated a very high number of false-positives in both real and simulated data. Model-based imputation methods typically generated fewer false-positives but this varied greatly depending on how well datasets conformed to the underlying model. Furthermore, only SAVER exhibited reproducibility comparable to unimputed data across matched data.
Conclusions: Imputation of single-cell RNASeq data introduces circularity that can generate false-positive results. Thus, statistical tests applied to imputed data should be treated with care. Additional filtering by effect size can reduce but not fully eliminate these effects. Of the methods we considered, SAVER was the least likely to generate false or irreproducible results, thus should be favoured over alternatives if imputation is necessary.},

This has led to an explosion of tailored analysis methods for scRNA-seq to address various biological questions. However, the current lack of gold-standard benchmarking datasets makes it difficult for researchers to evaluate the performance of the many methods. Here, we designed and carried out a realistic benchmark experiment that included mixtures of single cells or ‘pseudo-cells’ created by sampling admixtures of cells or RNA from 3 distinct cancer cell lines. Altogether we generated 10 datasets using a combination of droplet and plate-based scRNA-seq protocols, with varying data quality, population heterogeneity and noise levels. Using these benchmark datasets, we compared different protocols, evaluated the spike-in standard and multiple data analysis methods for tasks ranging from normalization and imputation, to clustering, trajectory analysis and data integration. Evaluation of methods across multiple datasets revealed some that performed well in general and others that suited specific situations. Our dataset and analysis provide a comprehensive comparison framework for benchmarking most popular scRNA-seq analysis tasks.},

Measurements from this technology are aﬀected by many technical artifacts, including batch eﬀects. In analogous bulk gene expression experiments, external references, e.g., synthetic gene spike-ins often from the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC), may be incorporated to the experimental protocol for use in adjusting measurements for technical artifacts. In scRNA-seq experiments, the use of external spike-ins is controversial due to dissimilarities with endogenous genes and uncertainty about suﬃcient precision of their introduction. Instead, endogenous genes with highly stable expression could be used as references within scRNA-seq to help normalize the data. First, however, a speciﬁc notion of stable expression at the single cell level needs to be formulated; genes could be stable in absolute expression, in proportion to cell volume, or in proportion to total gene expression. Diﬀerent types of stable genes will be useful for diﬀerent normalizations and will need diﬀerent methods for discovery.},

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from "regularized negative binomial regression," where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression.

We show that the log-transformation can introduce systematic errors when cells vary in sequencing coverage, leading to spurious non-zero differences in expression and artificial population structure in simulations. We observe similar effects in real scRNA-seq data where the difference in transformed values between groups of cells is not an accurate proxy for the log-fold change.

@article{linStableGenes2018,
    abstract = {Background: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling has revealed remarkable variation in transcription, suggesting that expression of many genes at the single-cell level is intrinsically stochastic and noisy. Yet, on the cell population level, a subset of genes traditionally referred to as housekeeping genes (HKGs) are found to be stably expressed in different cell and tissue types. It is therefore critical to question whether stably expressed genes (SEGs) can be identified on the single-cell level, and if so, how can their expression stability be assessed? We have previously proposed a computational framework for ranking expression stability of genes in single cells for scRNA-seq data normalization and integration. In this study, we perform detailed evaluation and characterization of SEGs derived from this framework. Results: Here, we show that gene expression stability indices derived from the early human and mouse development scRNA-seq datasets and the "Mouse Atlas" dataset are reproducible and conserved across species. We demonstrate that SEGs identified from single cells based on their stability indices are considerably more stable than HKGs defined previously from cell populations across diverse biological systems. Our analyses indicate that SEGs are inherently more stable at the single-cell level and their characteristics reminiscent of HKGs, suggesting their potential role in sustaining essential functions in individual cells. Conclusions: SEGs identified in this study have immediate utility both for understanding variation and stability of single-cell transcriptomes and for practical applications such as scRNA-seq data normalization. Our framework for calculating gene stability index, "scSEGIndex," is incorporated into the scMerge Bioconductor R package (https://sydneybiox.github.io/scMerge/reference/scSEGIndex.html) and can be used for identifying genes with stable expression in scRNA-seq datasets.},

We describe a droplet-based system that enables 3′ mRNA counting of tens of thousands of single cells per sample. Cell encapsulation, of up to 8 samples at a time, takes place in ∼6 min, with ∼50\% cell capture efficiency. To demonstrate the system’s technical performance, we collected transcriptome data from ∼250k single cells across 29 samples. We validated the sensitivity of the system and its ability to detect rare populations using cell lines and synthetic RNAs. We profiled 68k peripheral blood mononuclear cells to demonstrate the system’s ability to characterize large immune populations. Finally, we used sequence variation in the transcriptome data to determine host and donor chimerism at single-cell resolution from bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from transplant patients.},

	abstract = {Droplet single-cell RNA-sequencing (dscRNA-seq) has enabled rapid, massively parallel profiling of transcriptomes. However, assessing differential expression across multiple individuals has been hampered by inefficient sample processing and technical batch effects. Here we describe a computational tool, demuxlet, that harnesses natural genetic variation to determine the sample identity of each droplet containing a single cell (singlet) and detect droplets containing two cells (doublets). These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments in which cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than in standard workflows. Using simulated data, we show that 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per cell are sufficient to assign 97\% of singlets and identify 92\% of doublets in pools of up to 64 individuals. Given genotyping data for each of eight pooled samples, demuxlet correctly recovers the sample identity of {\textgreater}99\% of singlets and identifies doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. We apply demuxlet to assess cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in 8 pooled lupus patient samples treated with interferon (IFN)-β and perform eQTL analysis on 23 pooled samples.},

Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups.

We evaluated 36 approaches using experimental and synthetic data and found considerable differences in the number and characteristics of the genes that are called differentially expressed. Prefiltering of lowly expressed genes has important effects, particularly for some of the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data analysis. However, we found that bulk RNA-seq analysis methods do not generally perform worse than those developed specifically for scRNA-seq.

Many early analyses of differ- ential expression have aimed at identifying differences between subpopulations, and thus are focused on finding subpopulation markers either in a single sample or across multiple samples. More generally, such methods can compare expression levels in multiple sets of cells, thus lead- ing to cross-condition analyses. However, given the emergence of replicated multi-condition scRNA-seq datasets, an area of increasing focus is making sample-level inferences, termed here as differential state analysis. For example, one could investigate the condition-specific responses of cell subpopulations measured from patients from each condition; however, it is not clear which statistical framework best handles this situation. In this work, we surveyed the methods available to perform cross-condition differential state analyses, including cell- level mixed models and methods based on aggregated “pseudobulk” data. We developed a flexible simulation platform that mimics both single and multi-sample scRNA-seq data and provide robust tools for multi-condition analysis within the muscat R package.},

This provides biological resolution that cannot be matched by bulk RNA sequencing, at the cost of increased technical noise and data complexity. The differences between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data mean that the analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling bioinformatics pipelines for the latter. Rather, dedicated single-cell methods are required at various steps to exploit the cellular resolution while accounting for technical noise. This article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses of scRNA-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project. It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection. Analyses were demonstrated on gene-level count data from several publicly available datasets involving haematopoietic stem cells, brain-derived cells, T-helper cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. This will provide a range of usage scenarios from which readers can construct their own analysis pipelines.},

    abstract = {Motivation: Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the study of transcriptional heterogeneity at the resolution of individual cells and have an increasing impact on biomedical research. Specifically, high-throughput approaches that employ micro-fluidics in combination with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are capable of assaying many thousands of cells per experiment and are rapidly becoming commonplace. However, it is known that these methods sometimes wrongly consider two or more cells as single cells, and that a number of so-called doublets is present in the output of such experiments. Treating doublets as single cells in downstream analyses can severely bias a study's conclusions, and therefore computational strategies for the identification of doublets are needed. Here we present single cell doublet scoring (scds), a software tool for the in silico identification of doublets in scRNA-seq data. Results: With scds, we propose two new and complementary approaches for doublet identification: Co-expression based doublet scoring (cxds) and binary classification based doublet scoring (bcds). The co-expression based approach, cxds, utilizes binarized (absence/presence) gene expression data and employs a binomial model for the co-expression of pairs of genes and yields interpretable doublet annotations. bcds, on the other hand, uses a binary classification approach to discriminate artificial doublets from the original data. We apply our methods and existing doublet identification approaches to four data sets with experimental doublet annotations and find that our methods perform at least as well as the state of the art, but at comparably little computational cost. We also find appreciable differences between methods and across data sets, that no approach dominates all others, and we believe there is room for improvement in computational doublet identification as more data with experimental annotations becomes available. In the meanwhile, scds presents a scalable, competitive approach that allows for doublet annotations in thousands of cells in a matter of seconds. Availability and Implementation: scds is implemented as an R package and freely available at https://github.com/kostkalab/scds.},

Fundamental to the analysis of such scRNA-seq data is the ability to cluster similar or same cells into non-overlapping groups. Many competing methods have been proposed for this task, but there is currently little guidance with regards to which method to use. Methods: Here we use one gold standard 10x Genomics dataset, generated from the mixture of three cell lines, as well as multiple silver standard 10x Genomics datasets generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells to examine not only the accuracy but also running time and robustness of a dozen methods. Results: We found that Seurat outperformed other methods, although performance seems to be dependent on many factors, including the complexity of the studied system. Furthermore, we found that solutions produced by different methods have little in common with each other. Conclusions: In light of this we conclude that the choice of clustering tool crucially determines interpretation of scRNA-seq data generated by 10x Genomics. Hence practitioners and consumers should remain vigilant about the outcome of 10x Genomics scRNA-seq analysis.},

@article{haroTranslated2008,
    abstract = {A framework for the regularized and robust estimation of non-uniform dimensionality and density in high dimensional noisy data is introduced in this work. This leads to learning stratifications, that is, mixture of manifolds representing different characteristics and complexities in the data set. The basic idea relies on modeling the high dimensional sample points as a process of translated Poisson mixtures, with regularizing restrictions, leading to a model which includes the presence of noise. The translated Poisson distribution is useful to model a noisy counting process, and it is derived from the noise-induced translation of a regular Poisson distribution. By maximizing the log-likelihood of the process counting the points falling into a local ball, we estimate the local dimension and density. We show that the sequence of all possible local countings in a point cloud formed by samples of a stratification can be modeled by a mixture of different translated Poisson distributions, thus allowing the presence of mixed dimensionality and densities in the same data set. With this statistical model, the parameters which best describe the data, estimated via expectation maximization, divide the points in different classes according to both dimensionality and density, together with an estimation of these quantities for each class. Theoretical asymptotic results for the model are presented as well. The presentation of the theoretical framework is complemented with artificial and real examples showing the importance of regularized stratification learning in high dimensional data analysis in general and computer vision and image analysis in particular.},

@article{ChungJackstraw2015,
    abstract = {Motivation: There are a number of well-established methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) for automatically capturing systematic variation due to latent variables in large-scale genomic data. PCA and related methods may directly provide a quantitative characterization of a complex biological variable that is otherwise difficult to precisely define or model. An unsolved problem in this context is how to systematically identify the genomic variables that are drivers of systematic variation captured by PCA. Principal components (PCs) (and other estimates of systematic variation) are directly constructed from the genomic variables themselves, making measures of statistical significance artificially inflated when using conventional methods due to over-fitting. Results: We introduce a new approach called the jackstraw that allows one to accurately identify genomic variables that are statistically significantly associated with any subset or linear combination of PCs. The proposed method can greatly simplify complex significance testing problems encountered in genomics and can be used to identify the genomic variables significantly associated with latent variables. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our method attains accurate measures of statistical significance over a range of relevant scenarios. We consider yeast cell-cycle gene expression data, and show that the proposed method can be used to straightforwardly identify genes that are cell-cycle regulated with an accurate measure of statistical significance. We also analyze gene expression data from post-trauma patients, allowing the gene expression data to provide a molecularly driven phenotype. Using our method, we find a greater enrichment for inflammatory-related gene sets compared to the original analysis that uses a clinically defined, although likely imprecise, phenotype. The proposed method provides a useful bridge between large-scale quantifications of systematic variation and gene-level significance analyses.},

We introduce and test a dimensionality estimator, based on analysing the separability properties of data points, on several benchmarks and real biological datasets. We show that the introduced measure of ID has performance competitive with state-of-the-art measures, being efficient across a wide range of dimensions and performing better in the case of noisy samples.

One of the main challenges when analyzing scRNA-seq data is the presence of zeros or dropout events, which may mislead downstream analyses. To compensate the dropout effect, several methods have been developed to impute gene expression since the first Bayesian-based method being proposed in 2016. However, these methods have shown very diverse characteristics in terms of model hypothesis and imputation performance. Thus, large-scale comparison and evaluation of these methods is urgently needed now. To this end, we compared eight imputation methods, evaluated their power in recovering original real data, and performed broad analyses to explore their effects on clustering cell types, detecting differentially expressed genes, and reconstructing lineage trajectories in the context of both simulated and real data. Simulated datasets and case studies highlight that there are no one method performs the best in all the situations. Some defects of these methods such as scalability, robustness and unavailability in some situations need to be addressed in future studies.},

We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Miligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between ±1. {\textcopyright} 1985 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

In this work, we compare four different tools for single-cell RNA-sequencing differential expression, together with two popular methods originally developed for the analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data, but largely applied to single-cell data. We discuss results obtained on two real and one synthetic dataset, along with considerations about the perspectives of single-cell differential expression analysis. In particular, we explore the methods performance in four different scenarios, mimicking different unimodal or bimodal distributions of the data, as characteristic of single-cell transcriptomics.

With continued growth expected in scRNA-seq data, achieving effective batch integration with available computational resources is crucial. Here, we perform an in-depth benchmark study on available batch correction methods to determine the most suitable method for batch-effect removal. RESULTS We compare 14 methods in terms of computational runtime, the ability to handle large datasets, and batch-effect correction efficacy while preserving cell type purity. Five scenarios are designed for the study: identical cell types with different technologies, non-identical cell types, multiple batches, big data, and simulated data. Performance is evaluated using four benchmarking metrics including kBET, LISI, ASW, and ARI. We also investigate the use of batch-corrected data to study differential gene expression. CONCLUSION Based on our results, Harmony, LIGER, and Seurat 3 are the recommended methods for batch integration. Due to its significantly shorter runtime, Harmony is recommended as the first method to try, with the other methods as viable alternatives.},

@article{WangDE2019,
    abstract = {Background: The analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data plays an important role in understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular processes in biological and biomedical research. One significant effort in this area is the detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes. scRNAseq data, however, are highly heterogeneous and have a large number of zero counts, which introduces challenges in detecting DE genes. Addressing these challenges requires employing new approaches beyond the conventional ones, which are based on a nonzero difference in average expression. Several methods have been developed for differential gene expression analysis of scRNAseq data. To provide guidance on choosing an appropriate tool or developing a new one, it is necessary to evaluate and compare the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods for scRNAseq data. Results: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of eleven differential gene expression analysis software tools, which are designed for scRNAseq data or can be applied to them. We used simulated and real data to evaluate the accuracy and precision of detection. Using simulated data, we investigated the effect of sample size on the detection accuracy of the tools. Using real data, we examined the agreement among the tools in identifying DE genes, the run time of the tools, and the biological relevance of the detected DE genes. Conclusions: In general, agreement among the tools in calling DE genes is not high. There is a trade-off between true-positive rates and the precision of calling DE genes. Methods with higher true positive rates tend to show low precision due to their introducing false positives, whereas methods with high precision show low true positive rates due to identifying few DE genes. We observed that current methods designed for scRNAseq data do not tend to show better performance compared to methods designed for bulk RNAseq data. Data multimodality and abundance of zero read counts are the main characteristics of scRNAseq data, which play important roles in the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods and need to be considered in terms of the development of new methods.},

In order to understand the capabilities of these systems to deeply interrogate biology; here we provide a practical guide through all the steps involved in a typical scRNA-seq experiment. Through comparing and contrasting these three main droplet based systems (and their derivatives), we provide an overview of all critical considerations in obtaining high quality and biologically relevant data. We also discuss the limitations of these systems and how they fit into the emerging field of Genomic Cytometry.},

@article{HouImput2020,
    abstract = {The rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, with increased sparsity compared to bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), has led to the emergence of many methods for preprocessing, including imputation methods. Here, we systematically evaluate the performance of 18 state-of-the-art scRNA-seq imputation methods using cell line and tissue data measured across experimental protocols. Specifically, we assess the similarity of imputed cell profiles to bulk samples as well as investigate whether methods recover relevant biological signals or introduce spurious noise in three downstream analyses: differential expression, unsupervised clustering, and inferring pseudotemporal trajectories. Broadly, we found significant variability in the performance of the methods across evaluation settings. While most scRNA-seq imputation methods recover biological expression observed in bulk RNA-seq data, the majority of the methods do not improve performance in downstream analyses compared to no imputation, in particular for clustering and trajectory analysis, and thus should be used with caution. Furthermore, we find that the performance of scRNA-seq imputation methods depends on many factors including the experimental protocol, the sparsity of the data, the number of cells in the dataset, and the magnitude of the effect sizes. We summarize our results and provide a key set of recommendations for users and investigators to navigate the current space of scRNA-seq imputation methods.},

@article{GaoProcessing2020,
    abstract = {With the development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, it has become possible to perform large-scale transcript profiling for tens of thousands of cells in a single experiment. Many analysis pipelines have been developed for data generated from different high-throughput scRNA-seq platforms, bringing a new challenge to users to choose a proper workflow that is efficient, robust and reliable for a specific sequencing platform. Moreover, as the amount of public scRNA-seq data has increased rapidly, integrated analysis of scRNA-seq data from different sources has become increasingly popular. However, it remains unclear whether such integrated analysis would be biased if the data were processed by different upstream pipelines. In this study, we encapsulated seven existing high-throughput scRNA-seq data processing pipelines with Nextflow, a general integrative workflow management framework, and evaluated their performances in terms of running time, computational resource consumption, and data processing consistency using nine public datasets generated from five different high-throughput scRNA-seq platforms. Our work provides a useful guideline for the selection of scRNA-seq data processing pipelines based on their performances on different real datasets. In addition, these guidelines can serve as a performance evaluation framework for future developments in high-throughput scRNA-seq data processing.},

@article{KrzakClust2019,
    abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) is a powerful tool to study heterogeneity of cells. Recently, several clustering based methods have been proposed to identify distinct cell populations. These methods are based on different statistical models and usually require to perform several additional steps, such as preprocessing or dimension reduction, before applying the clustering algorithm. Individual steps are often controlled by method-specific parameters, permitting the method to be used in different modes on the same datasets, depending on the user choices. The large number of possibilities that these methods provide can intimidate non-expert users, since the available choices are not always clearly documented. In addition, to date, no large studies have invistigated the role and the impact that these choices can have in different experimental contexts. This work aims to provide new insights into the advantages and drawbacks of scRNAseq clustering methods and describe the ranges of possibilities that are offered to users. In particular, we provide an extensive evaluation of several methods with respect to different modes of usage and parameter settings by applying them to real and simulated datasets that vary in terms of dimensionality, number of cell populations or levels of noise. Remarkably, the results presented here show that great variability in the performance of the models is strongly attributed to the choice of the user-specific parameter settings. We describe several tendencies in the performance attributed to their modes of usage and different types of datasets, and identify which methods are strongly affected by data dimensionality in terms of computational time. Finally, we highlight some open challenges in scRNAseq data clustering, such as those related to the identification of the number of clusters.},
